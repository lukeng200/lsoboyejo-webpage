The low-lying coastal basins of Ravenna (Italy) are at or below mean sea level and currently undergoing land subsidence, which exposes the basins to frequent inundation and groundwater and soil salinization. The surface water drainage becomes necessary to lower the water table head and further prevent flooding and waterlogging. The study examines the evolution of drainage apropos to climate change and land subsidence in the three main Ravenna coastal basins. Our findings show that the evolution of drainage is influenced by land subsidence, climate change variability, droughts, vertical seepage, and local water management. Land subsidence causes an increase in upward-directed vertical seepage of saline water through the shallow unconfined aquifer into the drainage channels of the coastal basins, thus leading to an increase in drainage through time. At a seasonal timescale, the rate of pumping depends on antecedent rainfall and soil--water storage. The warming extremes indices, specifically drought indices, show to be more significant than rainfall indices trends to monitor drainage evolution. Drought indices permit easy comparison of dryness or wetness severity with drainage evolution along their time scale. The co-occurring anthropogenic and natural factors involving in the increasing drainage rate will affect decadal and seasonal water management policies in the area. The implications of increasing drainage rates, long periods of drought with limited rainfall, and increasing temperature will further worsen freshwater availability in this coastal area already experiencing soil and water salinization. However, drainage of this low-lying territory has effectively mitigated rising water tables and avoided flooding. Our study has shown that each coastal basin behaves differently in terms of sensitivity to land subsidence and climate extremes. Therefore, when using drainage data time series for water management purposes, one should account for past management practices and for the specific sensitivity of each basin to external factors.
