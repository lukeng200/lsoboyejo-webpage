About Me:
</h2>

<p class="lead">
### üåç Who I Am
I am an environmental manager and scientist with a strong foundation in water resources management, environmental assessment, and urban stream management, currently working on [predicting urban channel form and related geomorphic disturbance to urbanisation](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1947357-predicting-urban-channel-morphology-amidst-multiple-complexities?cache=1732788019141).

### üéØ What I want
I am always seeking an advanced role where I can apply my technical (research) expertise and project delivery experience improve water and coastal resources, as well as the health of catchments and urban waterways.

### üí° What I believe
I am passionate about integrating science with practice to inform sustainable and equitable environmental management. I believe in collaborative, evidence-based approaches that empower governments or councils and communities to take active ownership of their local ecosystems.

Currently a PhD researcher \| Geomorphology and earth surface processes <br> [Univeristy of Melbourne](https://safes.unimelb.edu.au/research/werg), Australia

Thanks ! üôè , because you are part of the story.
