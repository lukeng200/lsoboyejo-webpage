About Me 👨‍🎓

</h2>

<p class="lead">

Life is a function that depends on many variables.

In 2015, I completed my bachelor's degree in <a href = "https://funaab.edu.ng/section/water-resources-management-and-agricultural-meteorology/"> Water Resources Management and Agrometeorology</a> with a major in Hydrology from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria.</a>

In 2020, I completed an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in <a href = "https://wacoma.unibo.it/promotion_dissemination.php"> Water and Coastal Management</a>, fully funded by the <a href = "https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-individuals/students/erasmus-mundus-joint-masters-scholarships"> European Union</a>, and hosted by the <a href = "https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/wacoma"> University of Bologna</a> (Italy), the <a href = "https://ccmaryambientales.uca.es/water-and-coastal-management-wacoma/"> University of Cadiz</a> (Spain), and the <a href = "https://www.ualg.pt/en/erasmus-mundus"> University of Algarve</a> (Portugal). In Italy, the programme is recognised as the international curriculum of the second cycle degree in LM-75 Environmental Assessment and Management</a>.

Currently a PhD Student <br> [Univeristy of Melbourne](https://ecosystemforest.unimelb.edu.au/research), Australia
